A simple PDF reader for fully and correctly render on all browsers.

NOTES:

The <embed> is use because all browsers supported this tag and render correctly, <iframe> and <object> caused some problems on our tests.

The reader is worked with "javascript - document.write" because in pure HTML is impossible determinate 100% x 100% dimension of a embed tag.

The "toolbar", "navpanes" and "scrollbar" are boolean attributes.
